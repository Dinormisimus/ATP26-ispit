## User Experience Design
User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of supporting user behavior through usability, accessibility, and desirability provided in the interaction with a product.

## History
The field of user experience design is a conceptual design discipline and has its roots in human factors and ergonomics, a field that, since the late 1940s, has focused on the interaction between human users, machines, and the contextual environments.

## Elements of User Experience
UX design involves a sequence of interactions between a user and a product. According to Jesse James Garrett, the elements are:
* **The Strategy Plane**: User needs and product objectives.
* **The Scope Plane**: Functional specifications and content requirements.
* **The Structure Plane**: Interaction design and information architecture.
* **The Skeleton Plane**: Interface design and navigation.
* **The Surface Plane**: Visual design.

## The Process of User Experience Design
Designers use various methods to solve problems:
1. Researching the users.
2. Creating personas.
3. Information Architecture (IA).
4. Wireframing and Prototyping.

## Test and Iterate
Testing is a fundamental part of the UX process to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
