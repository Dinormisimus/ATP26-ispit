## User Experience Design
User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD), upon which is the centralized requirements for "User Experience Design Research" (also known as UX Design Research), defines the experience a user would go through when interacting with a company, its services, and its products. User experience design is a user centered design approach because it considers the user's experience when using a product or platform. Research, data analysis, and test results drive design decisions in UX design rather than aesthetic preferences and opinions, for which is known as UX Design Research. Unlike user interface design, which focuses solely on the design of a computer interface, UX design encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience with a product or website, such as its usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall performance. UX design is also an element of the customer experience (CX), and encompasses all design aspects and design stages that are around a customer's experience.

## History
The field of user experience design is a conceptual design discipline and has its roots in human factors and ergonomics, a field that, since the late 1940s, has focused on the interaction between human users, machines, and the contextual environments.

## Elements of User Experience
UX design involves a sequence of interactions between a user and a product. According to Jesse James Garrett, the elements are:
* **The Strategy Plane**: User needs and product objectives.
* **The Scope Plane**: Functional specifications and content requirements.
* **The Structure Plane**: Interaction design and information architecture.
* **The Skeleton Plane**: Interface design and navigation.
* **The Surface Plane**: Visual design.

## The Process of User Experience Design
Designers use various methods to solve problems:
1. Researching the users.
2. Creating personas.
3. Information Architecture (IA).
4. Wireframing and Prototyping.

## Test and Iterate
Testing is a fundamental part of the UX process to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
